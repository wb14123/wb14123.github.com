				<title>A Review on Spanner and Open Source Implementations</title>
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub39966&quot;&gt;Spanner paper&lt;/a&gt; is published, the use of synced clock to implement globally distributed database attracted a lot of attentions. After these years, Google have put Spanner on its cloud to make everyone be able to use it. And there are also some open source implementations of Spanner in these years. In this article, I’d like to write about how does synced clock makes Spanner special, some notes of using it and how others implement it without special hardware clock.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>My 2017 Year in Review</title>
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;When I open my blog, I suddenly realized that I haven’t even writen one blog in 2017. I’ve tried to write some blogs about technology but it spent too much time and energy so I gave up at last. There happens a lot of things on me in 2017. So I must write something while the next year is beginning. Things have changed both on my life and my work. I don’t want to write too many details on my personal life, so I will just record some work related things.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Build a Unix Like Environment on Windows</title>
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve bought a Surface Pro 4 some days ago. It is very amazing and I’d like to use it as my backup development laptop. My daily development is under Linux and Mac OS X. I use terminal and lots of bash scripts everyday. So I need a Unix-like environment on Windows. This article will introduce how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>读《邓小平时代》有感</title>
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;最近花了一个周末加一些零零散散的时间把傅高义的《邓小平时代》这本书看完了。这本书的内容，总体上讲对邓小平的评价是正面的。里面讲的历史，我之前多多少少都了解过一些，而通过这本书，对这段历史的了解更加系统了一些。&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Config sbt to Use Both Proxy and Self Hosted Repositories</title>
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;While building Scala projects, we usually use a proxy to make the build faster. On the other hand, we usually use another repository to host our internal dependencies, which usually has a password to protect it from unwanted access. Both things are good and necessary. But if you want to use both of them, you will find it’s very tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Build A Computer for Deep Learning</title>
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;These days, I bought some hardware and build a computer by myself. It’s fun and I’ve learned lots of things from it. Here is a note to record it.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to Put RNN Layers Into Neural Network Model</title>
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in neural networks, you must have ever read and learn lots of things about RNN, which can reason about sequences of data. RNN is awesome and very fun to play with, if you haven’t heard of it, you can read &lt;a href=&quot;http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/&quot;&gt;this great article&lt;/a&gt; which train a char level RNN model to generate text.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Permission Management of Android Becomes A Bigger Problem When It Comes to Wearable Devices and TV</title>
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;The permission management of Android is a problem for a long time. The behaviour of an app depends on the morality of its developers. Unluckily, many developers are big companies which making money is their primary target and morality is little considered.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Use Redis Instead of Spark Streaming to Count Statistics</title>
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;In my work, I need to count basic statistics of streaming data, such as mean, variance, sum and so on. At first, I’m using Spark, then Spark Streaming. But after a while, I reimplemented it with Redis and find it is much better. I’d like to talk about them in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Install BLAS Library for MXNet</title>
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet&quot;&gt;MXNet&lt;/a&gt; is a deep learning library. I read its doc and some of its source code. It looks very good. So I’d like to install and try it. While I’m following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mxnet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/build.html#build-mxnet-library&quot;&gt;installing guide&lt;/a&gt; to install it on Mac OS X, it failed to compile with the error &lt;code&gt;cblas.h&lt;/code&gt; not found. The message pointed out I may miss the BLAS library.&lt;/p&gt;
